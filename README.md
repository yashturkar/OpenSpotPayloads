# OpenSpotPayloads

**OpenSpotPayloads** is an open-source, modular payload system for Boston Dynamics Spot.  
It enables researchers and practitioners to rapidly integrate **hot-swappable sensors**, **Jetson compute**, and **long-range networking** for field robotics research.  

> 📩 Interested in early access? Email me to get involved before the first release.

## ✨ Features
- **Modular Payload Mounts** — lightweight, field-tested designs for attaching compute, radios, and sensors.  
- **Hot-Swappable Sensors** — swap sensors on-the-fly, no tools required. 
- **Integrated Networking** — onboard switch + long-range Ubiquiti Bullet link.  
- **Compute Integration** — NVIDIA Jetson payload support.  
- **Teleoperation Support** — Steam Deck–based ROS 2 interface.

## 📂 Repository Status
This repository is **under development**.  
We are releasing the following components in stages:
- CAD models (STEP/STL) for modular mounts.  
- Electronics schematics, BOM, and power budget.  
- ROS 2 nodes for sensor drivers and system bring-up.  
- Example datasets (rosbags, logs) from deployments.  
- Documentation and setup guides.
