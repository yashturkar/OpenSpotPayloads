# OpenSpotPayloads

**OpenSpotPayloads** is an open-source, modular payload system for Boston Dynamics Spot.  
It enables researchers and practitioners to rapidly integrate **hot-swappable sensors**, **Jetson compute**, and **long-range networking** for field robotics deployments.  

> 📩 Interested in early access? Email me to get involved before the first release.

## ✨ Features
- **Modular Payload Mounts** — lightweight, field-tested designs for attaching compute, radios, and sensors.  
- **Hot-Swappable Sensors** — swap sensors on-the-fly, no tools required. 
- **Integrated Networking** — onboard switch + long-range Ubiquiti Bullet link.  
- **Compute Integration** — NVIDIA Jetson payload support.  
- **Teleoperation Support** — Steam Deck–based ROS 2 interface.
